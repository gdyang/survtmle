\arguments{
\item{dataList}{A list of \code{data.frame} objects as described in
\code{?makeDataList}.}

\item{adjustVars}{Object of class \code{data.frame} that contains the
variables to adjust for in the regression.}

\item{t0}{The timepoint at which \code{survtmle} was called to evaluate.
Needed only because the naming convention for the regression if
\code{t == t0} is different than if \code{t != t0}.}

\item{SL.ctime}{A character vector or list specification to be passed to the
\code{SL.library} argument in the call to \code{SuperLearner} for the
outcome regression (either cause-specific hazards or conditional mean).
See \code{?SuperLearner} for more information on how to specify valid 
\code{SuperLearner} libraries. It is expected that the wrappers used
in the library will play nicely with the input variables, which will
be called \code{"trt"} and \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.ctime}{A character specification of the right-hand side of the
equation passed to the \code{formula} option of a call to \code{glm}
for the outcome regression (either cause-specific hazards or
conditional mean). Ignored if \code{SL.ctime != NULL}. Use \code{"trt"}
to specify the treatment in this formula (see examples). The formula
can additionally include any variables found in
\code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.family}{The type of regression to be performed if fitting GLMs in
the estimation and fluctuation procedures. The default is "binomial"
for logistic regression. Only change this from the default if there
are justifications that are well understood. This is inherited from
the calling function (either \code{mean_tmle} or \code{hazard_tmle}).}

\item{returnModels}{A boolean indicating whether to return the
\code{SuperLearner} or \code{glm} objects used to estimate the
nuisance parameters. Must be set to \code{TRUE} if the user plans to
use calls to \code{timepoints} to obtain estimates at times other than
\code{t0}. See \code{?timepoints} for more information.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean indicating whether the function should print
messages to indicate progress.}

\item{gtol}{The truncation level of predicted censoring survival to handle
positivity violations.}

\item{...}{Other arguments. Not currently used.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list that is exactly the same as the input
        \code{dataList}, but with a column named \code{G_dC} added to it,
        which is the estimated conditional survival distribution for the
        censoring variable evaluated at the each of the rows of each
        \code{data.frame} in \code{dataList}.
}
\description{
Computes an estimate of the hazard for censoring using either \code{glm} or
\code{SuperLearner} based on log-likelihood loss. The function then computes
the censoring survival distribution based on these estimates. The structure
of the function is specific to how it is called within \code{survtmle}. In
particular, \code{dataList} must have a very specific structure for this
function to run properly. The list should consist of \code{data.frame}
objects. The first will have the number of rows for each observation equal to
the \code{ftime} corresponding to that observation. The subsequent entries
will have \code{t0} rows for each observation and will set \code{trt} column
equal to each value of \code{trtOfInterest} in turn. One of these columns
must be named \code{C} that is a counting process for the right-censoring
variable. The function will fit a regression with \code{C} as the outcome and
functions of \code{trt} and \code{names(adjustVars)} as specified by
\code{glm.ctime} or \code{SL.ctime} as predictors.
