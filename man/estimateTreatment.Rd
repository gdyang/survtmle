\arguments{
\item{dat}{An object of class \code{data.frame}. Must have named column
\code{trt}.}

\item{adjustVars}{An object of class \code{data.frame} that will be used
either as the \code{data} argument in a call to \code{glm} or as the
\code{X} object in a call to \code{SuperLearner}.}

\item{glm.trt}{A character formula for the right-hand side of \code{formula}
in a call to \code{glm}. See \code{?survtmle} for more documentation.
Alternatively, this could be an object of class \code{glm} (as in
calls to this function via \code{timepoints}), in which case
predictions are obtained using this object with no new fitting.}

\item{SL.trt}{A valid specification of the \code{SL.library} option of a call
to \code{SuperLearner}. See \code{?survtmle} for more documentation.
Alternatively, this could be an object of class \code{SuperLearner}
(as in calls to this function via \code{timepoints}), in which case
predictions are obtained using this object with no new fitting.}

\item{returnModels}{A boolean indicating whether fitted model objects should
be returned.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean passed to the \code{verbose} option of the call to
\code{SuperLearner}.}

\item{gtol}{The truncation level of predicted trt probabilities to handle
positivity violations.}

\item{...}{Other arguments. Not currently used}
}
\value{
dat The input \code{data.frame} object with two added columns
        corresponding with the conditional probability (given
        \code{adjustVars}) of \code{trt==max(trt)} and \code{trt==min(trt)}.

trtMod If \code{returnModels = TRUE}, the fitted \code{glm} or
        \code{SuperLearner} object. Otherwise, \code{NULL}
}
\description{
This function computes the conditional probability of having \code{trt} for
each specified level either using \code{glm} or \code{SuperLearner}.
Currently only two unique values of treatment are acceptable. By default the
function will compute estimates of the conditional probability of
\code{trt == max(trt)} and compute the probability of \code{trt == min(trt)}
as one minus this probability.
