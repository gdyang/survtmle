\arguments{
\item{wideDataList}{A list of \code{data.frame} objects.}

\item{t}{The timepoint at which to compute the iterated mean.}

\item{whichJ}{Numeric value indicating the cause of failure for which
regression should be computed.}

\item{allJ}{Numeric vector indicating the labels of all causes of failure.}

\item{t0}{The timepoint at which \code{survtmle} was called to evaluate.
Needed only because the naming convention for the regression if
\code{t == t0} is different than if \code{t != t0}.}

\item{adjustVars}{Object of class \code{data.frame} that contains the
variables to adjust for in the regression.}

\item{SL.ftime}{A character vector or list specification to be passed to the
\code{SL.library} argument in the call to \code{SuperLearner} for the
outcome regression (either cause-specific hazards or conditional mean).
See \code{?SuperLearner} for more information on how to specify valid
\code{SuperLearner} libraries. It is expected that the wrappers used
in the library will play nicely with the input variables, which will
be called \code{"trt"} and \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.ftime}{A character specification of the right-hand side of the
equation passed to the \code{formula} option of a call to \code{glm}
for the outcome regression (either cause-specific hazards or
conditional mean). Ignored if \code{SL.ftime != NULL}. Use \code{"trt"}
to specify the treatment in this formula (see examples). The formula
can additionally include any variables found in
\code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean indicating whether the function should print
messages to indicate progress.}

\item{returnModels}{A boolean indicating whether to return the
\code{SuperLearner} or \code{glm} objects used to estimate the
nuisance parameters. Must be set to \code{TRUE} if the user plans to
use calls to \code{timepoints} to obtain estimates at times other than
\code{t0}. See \code{?timepoints} for more information.}

\item{bounds}{A list of bounds to be used when performing the outcome
regression (Q) with the Super Learner algorithm. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.}

\item{...}{Other arguments. Not currently used.}
}
\value{
The function then returns a list that is exactly the same as the
        input \code{wideDataList}, but with a column named \code{Qj.t} added
        to it, which is the estimated conditional mean of \code{Qj.star.t+1}
        evaluated at the each of the rows of each \code{data.frame} in
        \code{wideDataList}.
}
\description{
This function computes an estimate of the G-computation regression at a
specified time \code{t} using either \code{glm} or \code{SuperLearner}. The
structure of the function is specific to how it is called within
\code{mean_tmle}. In particular, \code{wideDataList} must have a very
specific structure for this function to run properly. The list should consist
of \code{data.frame} objects. The first should have all rows set to their
observed value of \code{trt}. The remaining should in turn have all rows set
to each value of \code{trtOfInterest} in the \code{survtmle} call. Currently
the code requires each \code{data.frame} to have named columns for each name
in \code{names(adjustVars)}, as well as a column named \code{trt}. It must
also have a columns named \code{Nj.Y} where j corresponds with the numeric
values input in \code{allJ}. These are the indicators of failure due to the
various causes before time \code{t} and are necessary for determining who to
include in the regression. Similarly, each \code{data.frame} should have a
column call \code{C.Y} where Y is again \code{t - 1}, so that right censored
observations are not included in the regressions. The function will fit a
regression with \code{Qj.star.t+1} (also needed as a column in
\code{wideDataList}) on functions of \code{trt} and \code{names(adjustVars)}
as specified by \code{glm.ftime} or \code{SL.ftime}.
