\arguments{
\item{wideDataList}{A list of \code{data.frame} objects.}

\item{t}{The timepoint at which to compute the iterated mean.}

\item{uniqtrt}{The values of \code{trtOfInterest} passed to \code{mean_tmle}.}

\item{whichJ}{Numeric value indicating the cause of failure for which
regression should be computed.}

\item{allJ}{Numeric vector indicating the labels of all causes of failure.}

\item{t0}{The timepoint at which \code{survtmle} was called to evaluate.
Needed only because the naming convention for the regression if
\code{t == t0} is different than if \code{t != t0}.}

\item{Gcomp}{A boolean indicating whether \code{mean_tmle} was called to
evaluate the G-computation estimator, in which case this function does
nothing but re-label columns.}

\item{bounds}{A list of bounds to be used when performing the outcome
regression (Q) with the Super Learner algorithm. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.}

\item{msm.formula}{A valid right-hand-side of a formula that can include
variables \code{trt} and \code{colnames(adjustVars)}}

\item{msm.family}{A family argument for the msm (either \code{"gaussian"} for
an L-2 projection onto a linear MSM or \code{"binomial"} for a
Kulback-Leibler projection onto a logistic-linear MSM}

\item{...}{Other arguments. Not currently used.}

\value{
The function then returns a list that is exactly the same as the
        input \code{wideDataList}, but with a column named \code{Qj.star.t}
        added to it, which is the fluctuated conditional mean of
        \code{Qj.star.t+1} evaluated at the each of the rows of each
        \code{data.frame} in \code{wideDataList}.
}
\description{
This function performs a fluctuation of an initial estimate of the
G-computation regression at a specified time \code{t} using a call to
\code{glm} (i.e., a logistic submodel) or a call to \code{optim} (if bounds
are specified). The structure of the function is specific to how it is called
within \code{mean_tmle}. In particular, \code{wideDataList} must have a very
specific structure for this function to run properly. The list should consist
of \code{data.frame} objects. The first should have all rows set to their
observed value of \code{trt}. The remaining should in turn have all rows set
to each value of \code{trtOfInterest} in the \code{survtmle} call. The latter
will be used to obtain predictions that are then mapped into the estimates of
the cumulative incidence function at \code{t0}. Currently the code requires
each \code{data.frame} to have named columns for each name in
\code{names(adjustVars)}, as well as a column named \code{trt}. It must also
have a columns named \code{Nj.Y} where j corresponds with the numeric values
input in \code{allJ}. These are the indicators of failure due to the various
causes before time \code{t} and are necessary for determining who to include
in the fluctuation regression. Similarly, each \code{data.frame} should have
a column call \code{C.Y} where Y is again \code{t-1}, so that right censored
observations are not included in the regressions. The function will fit a
logistic regression with \code{Qj.star.t + 1} as outcome (also needed as a
column in \code{wideDataList}) with offset \code{qlogis(Qj.star.t)} and
number of additional covariates given by \code{length(trtOfInterest)}. These
additional covariates should be columns in the each \code{data.frame} in
\code{wideDataList} called \code{H.z.t} where \code{z} corresponds to a each
unique value of \code{trtOfInterest}. The function returns the same
\code{wideDataList}, but with a column called \code{Qj.star.t} added to it,
which is the fluctuated initial regression estimate evaluated at the observed
data points.
